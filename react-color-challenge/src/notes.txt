A customer has delivered a requirements document with the following requirements:
 - There shall be an API running in the cloud that serves random colors when       requested. (This already exists.)
 - There shall be a web app that requests a list of random colors from the API. (This is that app.) 
 - For each color returned by the API, a button shall be rendered.
 - The button's background color should be set to its corresponding color.
 - When clicked, the button shall alert the user of its color value. For example, a button with the color red shall alert, "My color is red."
 - There shall be a counter displaying how many times any button was clicked (not a specific button, but any button).

  The code for the front end of this application is written below, but there are problems with the code. It is not maintainable, and it's only capable of displaying hardcoded colors -- not a random array of colors from an API.

  Please refactor/fix the below code, making it as small and maintainable as possible. You can make any changes you'd like.

  Read all comments in this file carefully. Seemingly unimportant details may reveal more optimal approaches.
  Once you are finished, please email the improved code to magnus.bakke@gamechangesolar.com. After your response is submitted, we will have another meeting to go through your implementation. That is also your chance to point out any mistakes you may have made.
  Note that this is not only an exercise in displaying knowledge of React, but more so an exercise in showing your ability to learn new concepts (your experience with React will be taken into consideration), your reasoning skills, ability to explain your thought process, and review code.

  Comments in the code are appreciated.


// Considerations:
// You do not know how many colors there will be.
// You do not know which colors will be returned by the API.
// You can assume that all colors returned will be unique.
// The colors returned by the API can be any valid CSS color.
// Examples of valid CSS colors: red, #FF0000, hsl(0, 100%, 50%), rgb(255, 0, 0)
// When displaying the name of a color (e.g. "My color is red"), there is no need to translate between named and 
// unnamed colors. For example, you do not need to translate "#FF0000" to "red"; "My color is #FF0000" is fine.
